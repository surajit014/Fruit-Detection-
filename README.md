# Fruit-Detection-

Overview
This project implements a deep learning-based fruit detection system using the YOLOv8 object detection model. The dataset is sourced from Roboflow, and the model is trained using the Ultralytics YOLOv8 framework. The system can detect and classify different types of fruits in images.

Dataset Format: YOLOv8 format (images and corresponding annotations in .yaml and .txt files).
Dataset Usage: The dataset is structured for object detection tasks.

Detection Results:
Bounding boxes are drawn around detected fruits.
Results are saved as an image and text file.

Project Summary
Technologies Used :
Roboflow: For dataset management
Ultralytics YOLOv8: Object detection framework
Python Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, TensorFlow

Expected Outcomes :
A trained YOLOv8 model that can detect and classify different fruits in images.
A deployed inference system that processes test images and provides accurate fruit detection.
